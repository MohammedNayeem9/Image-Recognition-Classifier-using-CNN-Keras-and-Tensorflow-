# Image-Recognition-Classifier-using-CNN-Keras-and-Tensorflow-
 a simple image recognition tool that classifies whether the image is of a dog or a cat. The idea is to create a simple Cars/Bikes Image classifier and then applying the concepts on a bigger scale.
 
Plan of Attack
Its time to get into action and here is the plan —
1)Collecting the Dataset
2)Importing Libraries and Splitting the Dataset
3)Building the CNN
4)Full Connection
5)Data Augmentation
6)Training our Network
7)Testing

Step 1 — Collecting the Dataset
In order to train our machine, we need a huuuuggge amount of data so that our model can learn from them by identifying out certain relations and common features related to the objects.
Step 2 — Importing Libraries and Splitting the Dataset
To use the powers of the libraries, we first need to import them.
Step 3 — Buliding the CNN
This is most important step for our network. It consists of three parts -
1)Convolution
2)Polling
3)Flattening
Step 4 — Full Connection
Full connection is connecting our convolutional network to a neural network and then compiling our network.
Step 5 — Data Augmentation
While training your data, you need a lot of data to train upon. Suppose we have a limited number of images for our network. 
Step 6 — Training our Network
So, we completed all the steps of construction and its time to train our model.
Step 7 — Testing
Now lets test a random image.
You can even try it with your own image and see what it predicts. Whether you look close to a Car or a Bike.
